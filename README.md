# Random Forest Model for Isolation Source Prediction of *Cronobacter sakazakii* in the United States

# Binary Source Prediction (Food vs. Clinical)

This repository contains R scripts for predicting the isolation source (*Food* vs. *Clinical*) of *Cronobacter sakazakii* isolates in the United States using a random forest model trained on pan-genome gene presence/absence data.

## 🧠 Workflow Overview
1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**  
   Loads isolate metadata and gene presence/absence matrix, merges by isolate, and removes near-zero variance genes.

2. **Model Training**  
   Trains a random forest classifier (750 trees, 5-fold CV) using *caret* and *ranger*.

3. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluates model performance on a test set using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, confusion matrix, and feature importance analysis.
